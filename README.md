Vortex Quake 2
=====================================
Vortex Quake 2 is an RPG mod for Quake 2.

This repository takes the vrxcl repository (a fork of the original code), and integrates it with a few changes that were made to the original codebase after it was forked.

This repository is maintained by GHz, one of the original mod authors, and includes contributions from ky0ko, N4CH0!, Cacamenos, Darkzard and Lepi. Long live Vortex Quake 2!
